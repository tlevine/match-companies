The present package produces a data table about the entities who have bid on
contracts for projects funded by the World Bank Group. The resulting table is
called "companies.csv".

Within any project funded by the World Bank, many different contracts may be
involved. Several different bidders will bid on each contract. Bidders are
usually single companies, but they are sometimes joint ventures of multiple
companies. Each row in the "companies.csv" table corresponds to a company
inside a bidder inside a contract inside a project.

We have the following fields for each company.

project.name
    Name of the project that the company bid on
contract.uri
    Page on the World Bank website for the contract that the company bid on
contract.number
    Identification number for the contract
bidder.name
    This is the name of the bidder. This is not necessarily a company because
    a bidder can be a joint venture of multiple companies.
bidder.country
    Country for the bidder
bid.status
    Bids are "awarded" (evaluated and chosen) "evaluated" (evaluated and not chosen)
    or "rejected" (rejected before evaluation for not following formal bid procedures).
original.company.name
    Name of the company as listed on the World Bank website
opencorporates.company.name
    Original company names were reconciled with the Open Corporates reconciliation API.
    If a match was found, this field contains the Open Corporates name; otherwise,
    this field is empty.
opencorporates.company.uri
    Original company names were reconciled with the Open Corporates reconciliation API.
    If a match was found, this field contains the Open Corporates URI; otherwise,
    this field is empty.
